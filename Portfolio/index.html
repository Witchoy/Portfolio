            Hi! I'm Jules Goy, a French junior software developer. I'm
            passionate about video game development and Unix systems, and I also
            enjoy music, cinema, and comics.

        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          I am a French software development student in the second year of a BUT
          Informatique at the IUT, specializing in "Réalisation d'applications :
          conception, développement, validation." Throughout my studies, I have
          gained solid foundations in programming, web development, database
          management, system and network administration, and project management.
        </p>
        <p>
          My academic projects, such as Níðhöggr (Java/Angular/SQLite) and
          Torrington (C# with Godot, teamwork project), have allowed me to apply
          these skills in concrete contexts: from designing user interfaces and
          managing data to collaborating in a group and presenting results.
          These experiences, combined with personal projects like my WiMusic API
          (Node.js, TypeScript, Docker), have shaped my professional identity as
          a developer who values both technical quality and user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am particularly interested in full-stack web development and game
          development. I currently work with Unity and plan to explore Unreal
          Engine. Beyond coding, I draw inspiration from cinema, music, and
          comics, which nurture my creativity and curiosity.
