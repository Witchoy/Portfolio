      "I am a French software developer student in BUT Informatique, specializing in 'Réalisation d'applications : conception, développement, validation.' Throughout my studies, I have gained solid foundations in programming, web development, database management, system and network administration, and project management.",
      "My academic projects, such as Níðhöggr (TypeScript/Angular/Postgresql) and Torrington (C# with Godot, teamwork project), have allowed me to apply these skills in concrete contexts: from designing user interfaces and managing data to collaborating in a group and presenting results. These experiences, combined with personal projects like my WiMusic API (Node.js, TypeScript, Docker), have shaped my professional identity as a developer who values both technical quality and user experience.",
      "I am particularly interested in game development. I currently work with Unity and plan to explore Unreal Engine. Beyond coding, I draw inspiration from cinema, music, and comics, which nurture my creativity and curiosity."
